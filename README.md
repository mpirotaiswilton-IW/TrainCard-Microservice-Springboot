## Setup and Pre-requisites

1. If not already installed:

- Install Docker on your device (you can use the following link for a guide: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- Install the latest version of OpenJDK 17 on your device (The following page has a complete catalogue of OpenJDK downloads: [https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads))

2. Clone this repository or download the .zip file from GitHub (extract the downloaded zip file )

## Running the Microservice

1. Using a Command Line Interface of your choosing, change directory to the downloaded/cloned repository

2. Run the following command to build a .jar application file of the microservice: 

```
<# Linux/MacOs #>
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

<# Windows #>
.\mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```
3. If the build is a success, it should be indicated in your CLI. If it is successful, run this command to deploy it:

```
docker-compose up
```

3. 7 docker containers should now be running:
    * `microservice`: where the spring-boot api image, built using a Dockerfile, is containerized
    * `db`: where a Postgres database is containerized and used by the API
    * `kong-gateway`: where a Kong API gateway is containerized to route the API
    * `kong-db`: where a Postgres database is containerized and used by the Kong gateway
    * `kong-migration`: where a temporary Kong API Gateway runs the `kong migrations bootstrap` command to initialize the `kong-gateway` container
    * `pgadmin`: where a pgAdmin container is used to access both Postgres databases we have containerized.
    * `service-init`: where a shell script runs to set up our `kong-gateway` container with all the services and routes needed to access our microservice.

4. The microservice is now running, ready for use and is connected to the Kong API Gateway.

#### Verifying the containers are running

##### Microservice

Using a web browser of your choosing, head to <http://localhost:8080/person/1>. You should have accessed a microservice endpoint, which should return the following JSON object:
``` json
{
    "id":1,
    "firstName":"Therine",
    "lastName":"Henderson",
    "age":26,
    "sex":"Female"
}
```

##### pgAdmin

Using a web browser of your choosing, head to <http://localhost:5050/>. You should see the pgAdmin login page. To verify both databases, make sure to sign in using the following credentials:

* Email : `admin@admin.com`
* Password : `admin`

You can change these credentials under the following `pgadmin` container environment variables in the "[docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/mpirotaiswilton-IW/Info-Fetcher-Microservice/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml)" file: 

* `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL`
* `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`

##### Both databases

1. After successfully logging into pgAdmin, click on `Add New Server` on the Dashboard Home Page:
    * In the General tab, name your server as you see fit
    * Navigate to the Connection tab
    * For the `host name/address`, use the name of the Postgres container `db`
    * Make sure the port field is `5432`
    * the `Username` field is defined by the `POSTGRES_USER` environment variable for the `db` container in the `docker-compose.yaml` file
    * the `Password` field is defined by the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable for the `db` container in the `docker-compose.yaml` file
    * Click save and, in the Object explorer, under Servers you should see your newly saved server `db`. This is the database the microservice uses.

2. To verify the kong database is up, we will add another server. Navigate to the `Servers (1)` element in the Object explorer. In the Dashboard tab, click on `Add New Server` on the Dashboard Home Page:
    * In the General tab, name your server as you see fit
    * Navigate to the Connection tab
    * For the `host name/address`, use the name of the Postgres container `kong-database`
    * Make sure the port field is `5432`
    * the `Username` field is defined by the `POSTGRES_USER` environment variable for the `kong-database` container in the `docker-compose.yaml` file
    * the `Password` field is defined by the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable for the `kong-database` container in the `docker-compose.yaml` file
    * Click save and, in the Object explorer, under Servers you should see your newly saved server `kong-database`. This is the database the API gateway uses.

##### Kong Container

Using a web browser of choice, head to <http://localhost:8002/>. You should have accessed the Kong Manager GUI web page.

#### Cleaning up Exited Containers

At this point, there are 2 container which are no longer running: `kong-migration` and `service-init`. These containers have only ran to initialize and populate the Kong API gateway. To remove these exited containers, run the following command in a seperate CLI window: 
```
docker container prune -f
```

## Kong API Gateway

While we can access the microservice through the local host on port 8080, we want to access our API through the Kong API Gateway too. Fortunately, the `service-init` container has already populated the service and routes to access our microservice with the Kong Gateway.

Using a web browser of choice, head to <http://localhost:8002/default/services>. You should see a list of services under the `default` workspace and a service called `PeoplePerson-Get`. If you click on that item of the list then select the `Routes` tab, you should see a list of routes connected to the service and a route called `PeoplePerson-GetRoute`.

## Testing the Microservice

1. Import the Postman Collection provided as a .json file in this repository

2. Send the request from the endpoint "Get Person by ID"

3. You should get the following response body:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Therine",
    "lastName": "Henderson",
    "age": 26,
    "sex": "Female"
}
```
